## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **SOC-like monitoring environment** using the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** integrated with **Filebeat** to collect, parse, and visualize logs from:
- **Nagios** (Infrastructure & Service Monitoring)
- **OSSEC HIDS** (Host-based Intrusion Detection)
- **Suricata IDS/IPS** (Network Intrusion Detection & Prevention)

The goal is to enable **centralized log monitoring, real-time visualization, and alert correlation** for security and infrastructure events.

---

## ⚙️ Architecture
- **Nagios** → Monitors system health (CPU, memory, services, load, etc.) and sends alerts.  
- **OSSEC HIDS** → Monitors host activities, logs, and file integrity with agent-server communication.  
- **Suricata IDS/IPS** → Detects & logs suspicious/malicious network traffic (e.g., ICMP flood, port scans).  
- **Filebeat** → Forwards logs from each tool into **Logstash** → **Elasticsearch** → **Kibana Dashboard**.  

---

## 🔹 Tools Used
- **Nagios Core** (Service & Host Monitoring)
- **OSSEC HIDS v3.7.0** (Host-based Intrusion Detection)
- **Suricata IDS/IPS** (Network Threat Detection)
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** (Centralized log storage & visualization)
- **Filebeat** (Log shipping)

## 📊 Sample Dashboards & Logs

### 1️⃣ Nagios Integration
- Collected Nagios alerts (service failures, high load, HTTP/SSH monitoring).
- Visualized Nagios logs in **Kibana**.

---

### 2️⃣ OSSEC HIDS Integration
- OSSEC server-agent setup with log forwarding.
- Detects suspicious login attempts, server restarts, and file integrity violations.
- Alerts sent to **ELK** for centralized monitoring.

### 3️⃣ Suricata IDS/IPS Integration
- Suricata configured to log suspicious traffic (ICMP floods, scans).
- Logs parsed and visualized in **Kibana**.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Nagios, OSSEC, Suricata** generate logs locally.  
2. **Filebeat** collects these logs and forwards them to **Logstash**.  
3. **Logstash** parses and normalizes the logs.  
4. **Elasticsearch** indexes the logs.  
5. **Kibana** provides real-time dashboards and visualization.
